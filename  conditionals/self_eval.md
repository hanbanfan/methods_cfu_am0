# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
A conditional is useful when you need to make decisions in your code based on different conditions or inputs. It allows you to control the flow of your program by executing specific blocks of code only when certain conditions are met. For example, checking if a user is logged in before granting access, or deciding which output to display based on the value of a variable.
2. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
I would focus on experimenting with a wider range of values for the variables to ensure all possible scenarios are covered. Additionally, I would write comments as I go, explaining my thought process for each part of the code. This would help reinforce my understanding and make the code easier to revisit in the future.
3. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
The most satisfying part was seeing the conditional statements execute correctly and produce the expected results. It felt rewarding to troubleshoot and debug the code when needed, as it reinforced my understanding of how conditionals work in Ruby.
