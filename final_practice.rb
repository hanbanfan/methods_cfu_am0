# Defining Our Own Methods
# For each exercise below, write the method according to the requirements. 
# Call each method at least twice and store the return value in a variable. 
# Use the puts or print command to see the return value in the console.

# Example:
def laugh
  "Ha ha ha!!"
end

first_laugh = laugh 
last_laugh = laugh 

puts first_laugh
puts last_laugh


# 1: Write a method named "greeting" that returns a string with a generic greeting. 

# Call the method at least twice, and store the return value in a variable:

# Use the puts or print command to see the return value in the console:

# What is the return value of your method?
# How many arguments did you pass your method?


# 2: Write a method named "custom_greeting" that returns a greeting WITH a specific name.

# Call the method at least twice, and store the return value in a variable:

# Use the puts or print command to see the return value in the console:

# What is the return value of your method?
# How many arguments did you pass your method?
# What data type was your argument(s)?


# 3: Write a method named "greet_person" that takes in 3 strings, a first, middle, and last name, and returns a sentence with the full name.

# Call the method at least twice, and store the return value in a variable:

# Use the puts or print command to see the return value in the console:

# What is the return value of your method?
# How many arguments did you pass your method?
# What data type was your argument(s)?


# 4: Write a method named "square" that takes in one integer, and returns the square of that integer.

# Call the method at least twice, and store the return value in a variable:

# Use the puts or print command to see the return value in the console:

# What is the return value of your method?
# How many arguments did you pass your method?
# What data type was your argument(s)?

# Bonus: Print a sentence that interpolates the return value of your square method.


# 5: Write a method named "check_stock" that satisfies the following interaction pattern:
# Hint: You will only write one check_stock method that checks the quantity and then prints the corresponding statement.

check_stock(4, "Coffee");
# => "Coffee is stocked"

check_stock(3, "Tortillas");
# => "Tortillas - running LOW"

check_stock(0, "Cheese");
# => "Cheese - OUT of stock!"

check_stock(1, "Salsa");
# => "Salsa - running LOW"
