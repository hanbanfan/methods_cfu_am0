# Reflecting on learning and work today
puts "Reflection: I am most proud of my ability to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces. Writing methods has helped me better understand how to structure code logically."

# The power of using methods in our applications
puts "The power of using methods lies in their ability to make code reusable, organized, and easier to read. By encapsulating logic into methods, we can reduce redundancy and write more efficient and maintainable programs."
